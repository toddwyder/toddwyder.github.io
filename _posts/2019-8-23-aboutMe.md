title: About Me
---

I studied Computer Science at Northwestern University and worked as a C/C++ programmer for
3 years before I moved into management.  I spent 30 years working as an executive in software companies.  During that time, I have spoken at many software conferences and served as the Vice President of the Object Management Group, which is a major standards organization.

As I was trying to figure out what the next chapter of my life was going to be, I read an article in Wired magazine, [Why I Still Love Tech: In Defense of a Difficult Industry](https://www.wired.com/story/why-we-love-tech-defense-difficult-industry/), by Paul Ford.  In the article he talks about how much he enjoys crafting code.  As I read it, I reflected on how much I enjoyed writing code and decided I would pick it back up again.

So, this old dog is learning some new tricks.  In my blog, I discuss my journey as I see how much programming has changed in the past 30 years. I am really enjoying re-engaging with hands-on coding.
